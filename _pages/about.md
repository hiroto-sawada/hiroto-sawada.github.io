Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in politics at Princeton University.

My research interests include the political economy of conflict; international relations theory; alliance politics; and formal political theory.
My research appears in [_International Studies Quarterly_](https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqae023).
