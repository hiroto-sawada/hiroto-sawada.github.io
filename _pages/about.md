Welcome! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in politics at Princeton University and a graduate fellow at the Program for Quantitative and Analytical Political Science (QAPS).

My research interests include the political economy of conflict; the political economy of climate change; international relations/security; formal political theory; and theoretical implications of empirical models (TIEM).
My research appears in [_International Studies Quarterly_](https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqae023).

I received a B.A. in Policy Management (2013) and M.A.s in Media and Governance (2015) and Economics (2016) from Keio University, Japan. Prior to Princeton, I worked at the National Institute for Defense Studies (Ministry of Defense, Japan) as a research fellow, where I taught international relations to senior officers of the Self-Defense Forces.

I am **on the 2025-26 job market!**
The latest draft of my job market paper can be found [here](https://hiroto-sawada.github.io/files/Disaster_LatestDraft.pdf).
